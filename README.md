## 🧠 Approach

1. **Component-Based Architecture:**
   - The application is built using reusable React components, such as `Navbar`, `SideBar`, and `EmployeeTable`, to ensure modularity and scalability.

2. **State Management:**
   - Context API is used for managing global states like user authentication (`UserContext`) and sidebar visibility (`SidebarContext`).

3. **Styling:**
   - TailwindCSS is used for styling, enabling rapid UI development with utility-first CSS classes.

4. **Routing:**
   - React Router is used for navigation between pages like Login, Dashboard, and Employee Management.

5. **Data Handling:**
   - Static JSON files are used to simulate backend data for employees and other entities.

6. **Responsive Design:**
   - The layout is designed to be responsive, ensuring compatibility across different screen sizes.
